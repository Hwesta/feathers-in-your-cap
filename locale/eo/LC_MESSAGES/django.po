"<p>Feathers in your Cap is a birdwatching achievements site powered by eBird."
"</p> <p>Birding already has one major achievement: the lifelist! We're just "
"adding a few more. Have you seen all the common birds in your area? How "
"about a bird from every taxonomic order? It's harder than you might think!  "
"How many national birds have you seen in that country?</p> <p>Want to know "
"what achievements you've earned? Want to know how you compare to your "
"birding friends? Sign up and find out!</p> <h3>Why?</h3> <p>Feathers in your "
"Cap was created by Dale Floer and Holly Becker. We're both video gamers, and "
"soon after we got into birding we knew it was missing something: "
"achievements! Since achievements other than lifelist tracking didn't exist, "
"we decide to create it.</p>"
